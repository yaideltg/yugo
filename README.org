#+title: Yugo, a simple and responsive theme for Hugo
#+author: yaideltg

This is a theme for Hugo which is based only in Go, HTML and CSS. Its aim is to be really simple, but still
provide some nice functionalities like:
1. Multilingual support
2. Tags and categories in the side
3. RSS feeds for the whole site and each category independently
4. A list of the most recent posts in the *Home* page
5. A list of all the posts in the *Post* page, with functional pagination (set to 10 posts per page).


The game of the name is really a copy of the [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo][lugo theme]] by Luke Smith.

I wrote it myself from scratch, and it helped me a lot for understanding how things work in Hugo. It is not
maintained, as I believe there is nothing to maintain here.

I used it in my website [[https://poview.org/][poview.org]] since the beginning, but I wanted something more beautiful and with light/night
mode switching. Anyway it could be very useful for anyone wanting something simple and functional. Check out a
screenshot of the Home page here [[file:screenshot.png][Screenshot of the Home page]].
