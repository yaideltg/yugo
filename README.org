#+title: Yugo, a simple and responsive theme for Hugo
#+author: yaideltg

This is a theme for Hugo which is based only in HTML and CSS. Its aim is to be really simple, but still
provide some nice functionalities like:
1. Multilingual support
2. Tags and categories in the side
3. RSS feeds for the whole site and each category independently
4. A list of the most recent posts in the *Home* page
5. A list of all the posts in the *Post* page, with functional pagination (set to 10 posts per page).


The game of the name is really a copy of the [[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo][lugo theme]] by Luke Smith.
