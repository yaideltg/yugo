[RSS](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification) is an acronym for *Really Simple Syndication*. It allows to
obtain the updates that occur on the web pages ---or other mediums--- that it monitors, and it comes to be
sort of a subscription model. For its use it is necessary to have a software known as *News Aggregator*, which
is in charge of going to the web address that points to the *RSS feed* and updating the changes that have
been made.

*RSS feeds* are not limited to web pages only, but are also very popular in *podcasts* and
it is even possible to get one for Youtube channels.

This is a very convenient way to follow people's work, such as blogs, news, videos etc. The convenience is
that the publications are obtained daily, without any distraction, just what is important to you. In fact,
it's the system I use almost exclusively to keep up to date, although I have found that certain people do not
provide an *RSS feed* of their content.

Following this brief explanation you can find the *RSS Feed* of this site (in English). Afterwards, a feed for
each of the categories, in this way it is possible to select what type of content to follow.
