## Affiliate links

Another way of support is throughout Affiliate Links. The services proposed here are, as far as I know,
respectful with the user's freedom and privacy.

- [Tutanota affiliate link](https://mail.tutanota.com/signup?ref=bERxZ0FHUmk): for a year subscription you get
  a free month, and I get the 25% of that year's payment. See [detailed
  conditions](https://tutanota.com/faq#refer-a-friend).
